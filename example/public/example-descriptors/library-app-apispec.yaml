    description:
      text: The standard token authentication. This authentication method is only for demo purposes - the backend ignores the token in the current implementation.

        exampleValue: "aaa.bbbbbbb.ccc" # this value should be shared across all the schemes. It should have exactly the same scheme for each protocol - if it differs, then it should be separate authentication method
